# Strategic Timing Assessment

Determine optimal timing for major actions using Harriet Tubman's "Saturday Night" methodology - analyzing observation cycles, response delays, and cover conditions.

---

## When to Use

- Deciding when to make a major announcement or move
- Planning an exit (job, relationship, organization)
- Timing a launch, confrontation, or difficult conversation
- Request for "Saturday night timing" or "when should I make my move?"
- Any situation where timing significantly affects success

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| planned_action | Yes | What they want to do |
| stakeholders | No | Who will observe/respond to the action |
| constraints | No | Hard deadlines or timing limitations |
| current_conditions | No | What's happening now that affects timing |

---

## The Saturday Night Principle

Harriet Tubman began her rescue missions on Saturday nights. This wasn't arbitrary - it was strategic brilliance:

- **Observation cycle:** Newspapers didn't print on Sunday
- **Response delay:** Runaway notices couldn't appear until Monday
- **Cover conditions:** Maximum head start before organized pursuit began

**The insight:** Every system has observation cycles, response delays, and cover conditions. Understanding these allows you to maximize your window of advantage.

---

## The Strategic Timing Framework

### Step 1: Map the Observation Cycles

Who is watching, and when do they watch?

**Questions to answer:**
- Who will notice your action?
- How frequently do they check/observe?
- What triggers their attention?
- When is their attention lowest?

**Examples:**
- Boss's schedule: When are they in meetings, traveling, on vacation?
- Industry news cycles: When is attention on other events?
- Financial reporting: When are audits, reviews, closings?
- Social calendar: When are people distracted by holidays, events?

### Step 2: Identify Response Delays

How long before opposition can organize?

**Questions to answer:**
- Once noticed, how quickly can they respond?
- What approvals or coordination does response require?
- What's the minimum "newspaper delay" - time before the alarm spreads?
- How can you extend this delay?

**Examples:**
- Resignation: Notice period creates known delay
- Launch: Competitors need time to respond
- Announcement: News cycle moves on quickly
- Exit: Legal/HR processes take time

### Step 3: Find the Cover Conditions

What provides camouflage for your movement?

**Questions to answer:**
- What events or conditions mask your action?
- When is your move least remarkable?
- What distractions work in your favor?
- What legitimate reasons explain your preparation?

**Examples:**
- Year-end: Everyone is busy with holidays, reviews
- Industry conference: Conversations with competitors are normal
- Reorganization: Movement and change expected
- Major news event: Attention is elsewhere

### Step 4: Assess Your Runway

How much time/resources do you need for the move to succeed?

**Questions to answer:**
- What must be in place before you act?
- How long is the vulnerable period after action?
- What can go wrong and how long to recover?
- What's the minimum viable runway?

### Step 5: Calculate the Optimal Window

Combine all factors to identify the best timing.

**The ideal window:**
- Observation is at lowest point
- Response delay is maximized
- Cover conditions are present
- Runway is sufficient

**Warning signs of bad timing:**
- High observation period
- Rapid response capability
- Your action is highly visible
- Insufficient preparation

## Constraints

- Timing assessment is not an excuse for infinite delay
- Perfect timing rarely exists - good enough timing with action beats perfect timing never taken
- Update assessment if conditions change significantly
- Don't confuse strategic timing with procrastination from fear

## Example 1: Job Resignation

**Input:** "I have a new job offer and need to resign from my current position. My boss is already stressed about a major project deadline next month. When should I give notice?"

**Output:**

## Strategic Timing Assessment: Job Resignation

### Observation Cycle Analysis
| Observer | Watch Frequency | Attention Triggers | Low Points |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Boss | Daily | Project issues, team changes | After major deadlines, Friday afternoons |
| HR | Event-driven | Resignations trigger process | After monthly close |
| Team | Daily | Visible changes in behavior | When focused on own work |

**Current observation level:** HIGH (major project stress)

### Response Delay Analysis
**Time to notice:** Immediate upon resignation
**Time to organize response:** 1-2 days (knowledge transfer planning, HR process)
**Total "newspaper delay":** Your notice period (likely 2 weeks)

**Factors that extend delay:**
- Boss being overwhelmed may slow their counter-moves
- Standard HR process has built-in timeline

**Factors that shorten delay:**
- Boss might react emotionally and accelerate exit
- Critical project might trigger immediate transition demands

### Cover Conditions
**Currently present:**
- None favorable (high stress project)

**Upcoming:**
- After project deadline (major distraction removed)
- End of quarter (natural transition point)
- Friday afternoon (weekend buffer for emotions to settle)

**Could be created:**
- None needed - resignation is straightforward

### Runway Assessment
**Required runway:** New job start date minus notice period
**Current runway:** Depends on new employer flexibility
**Gap:** Negotiate start date with new employer if needed

### Optimal Timing Window

**Best window:** The Monday or Tuesday after the major project deadline
**Rationale:**
- Boss's stress is lower
- Project success is secured (if successful) - you leave on good terms
- Project failure is not attributed to your departure
- Early week allows time for professional handoff discussion

**Secondary window:** Friday afternoon, any week
**Rationale:** Weekend buffer for emotional processing; Monday brings clearer heads

**Timing to avoid:**
- During the project crunch (you'll be blamed for abandonment)
- Monday morning (boss is already stressed)
- Right before or during project deadline

### Countdown to Optimal Window
**If acting after project deadline (assume 4 weeks out):**
- Now: Confirm new job offer in writing, negotiate start date
- Week 2: Prepare handoff documentation quietly
- Week 3: Complete project responsibilities fully
- Week 4, Monday after deadline: Resign, morning, in person

### Contingency Timing
**If project extends:** Reassess based on new timeline; don't let new employer wait indefinitely
**If boss becomes suspicious:** Move to secondary window (Friday afternoon) immediately
**If new employer pushes start date:** Communicate constraints; most employers understand notice periods

## Example 2: Product Launch

**Input:** "We're ready to launch our competitor to a major established product. When should we announce?"

**Output:**

## Strategic Timing Assessment: Competitive Product Launch

### Observation Cycle Analysis
| Observer | Watch Frequency | Attention Triggers | Low Points |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Competitor | Continuous | Market mentions, PR | During their own crises/launches |
| Media/Press | Event-driven | News hooks, announcements | Holiday weeks, Friday afternoons |
| Target customers | Varies | Pain points, solutions | End of budget cycles |

**Current observation level:** Depends on your market presence

### Response Delay Analysis
**Time to notice:** Same day if any PR traction
**Time to organize response:** 2-6 weeks for competitor to mount real response (feature changes, pricing moves, counter-marketing)
**Total "newspaper delay":** 2-6 weeks to establish market position before competitive response

**Factors that extend delay:**
- Launching during competitor's busy season (distracted)
- Launching during industry event (competitor focused elsewhere)
- Competitor internal challenges (leadership changes, etc.)

**Factors that shorten delay:**
- Well-funded competitor with rapid response capability
- Your launch gets major press (forces their attention)
- Your targeting their key accounts directly

### Cover Conditions
**Currently present:**
- [Assess industry current events]

**Upcoming:**
- Major industry conference: Launch there for audience + competitor distraction
- Competitor's earnings call / major event: They're focused on own narrative
- End of quarter: Budget decisions being made by customers

**Could be created:**
- Time launch with thought leadership content establishing category
- Create "news hook" that frames your announcement

### Runway Assessment
**Required runway:** Support infrastructure must handle launch surge
**Current runway:** [Assess readiness]
**Gap:** [Identify what's needed]

### Optimal Timing Window

**Best window:** Industry conference where your target customers are present, ideally when competitor is also presenting (they're distracted, comparison is easy)
**Rationale:** Built-in audience, media present, competitor divided attention, natural news hook

**Secondary window:** Beginning of quarter when customers have fresh budgets
**Rationale:** Decision-makers have money to spend, open to new solutions

**Timing to avoid:**
- Competitor's major announcement day (you get drowned out)
- Dead press periods (August, late December)
- End of quarter when customers are budget-exhausted

### Countdown to Optimal Window
**If launching at industry conference (assume 8 weeks out):**
- Week 1-2: Finalize product, lock features
- Week 3-4: Prepare all launch materials, train support
- Week 5-6: Pre-brief key press and analysts under embargo
- Week 7: Beta access to strategic early customers
- Week 8: Conference launch with full activation

**Strategic advantage:** Your "Saturday night" is the conference - you get 2-6 weeks of customer conversations before competitor can mount meaningful response.
